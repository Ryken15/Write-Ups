When you try connecting to the defult port that mongo runs on, it gives you a message that
says, What if it isn't running on the main port?

Now to check what port it is actually running on we use the command: ps aux | grep mongo

This tells us that the port that mongo is running on is 12121

Now we use this command to connect to a specific mongo port

mongo --port 12121

Now that we are connected to the mongo database we can start searching through the collections.
We use the command show dbs to show all of the databases. 

They are : admin, elfu, local, and test

Now we can assume that we should be looking through elfu.
so we use the command use elfu to switch to that database. Then we use the command show collections
to show all of the collections in elfu. There are a lot of them but we only need to focus on the one 
called solution. You can try using that as your data base but it has no collections. What we need to do 
is to use the command for displaying the contents of a collection. That command would be db.solution.find()
And if you want it to look fancy use the command db.solution.find().pretty() The output of this funstion would be 
{
        "_id" : "You did good! Just run the command between the stars: ** db.loadServerScripts();displaySolution(); **"
}
Now just run this function inside of the database elfu and you will get the acheivment and a nice picture of a Christmas Tree.
